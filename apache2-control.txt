## All below commands to be prefaced by 'sudo'

## See hostname (IPv4 address) -- no need for sudo here though
# > hostname -I

## Or to see the public version of it (ie, what the rest of the world sees) -- no need for sudo here either
# > lynx icanhazip.com
# This returns the ip address in IPv4 format

## Start server
# > systemctl start apache2

## Check status
# > systemctl status apache2

## Stop server
# > systemclt stop apache2

## Restart server
# > systemctl restart apache2

## To restart after config changes without dropping any connections
# > systemctl reload apache2

## Disable auto-start at boot
# > systemctl disable apache2
## This seems to have issues. This link suggests other approach:
## https://askubuntu.com/questions/170640/how-to-disable-apache2-server-from-auto-starting-on-boot

## Enable auto-start at boot
# > systemctl enable apache2
