## All below commands to be prefaced by 'sudo'

## Start server
# > systemctl start mysql

## Check status
# > systemctl status mysql

## Stop server (need to shut down from within database, before ending the server process)
# > mysqladmin shutdown -u root -p
# > (password... enter)
# > systemclt stop mysql

## Disable auto-start at boot
# > systemctl disable mysql
## This seems to have issues though.

## Enable auto-start at boot
# > systemctl enable mysql
